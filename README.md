# Order-Details-SQL-Report
SQL-based report containing order details for analysis of sales, order trends, and customer behavior.

# Project Overview: Order Details Data Analysis

This project focuses on managing and analyzing detailed order transaction data typically found in e-commerce, retail, or inventory systems. The dataset contains order-level transaction details including:
- Unique order detail IDs (`order_details_id`)
- Associated order IDs (`order_id`)
- Order dates and times (`order_date`, `order_time`)
- Item identifiers (`item_id`)

## Core Components:
- **Order Details Table**: Stores granular information about each order line item.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Tracks order trends and volumes by date and time to identify peak order times or seasonal patterns.
- **Item-Level Insights**: Analyzes item popularity, sales quantities, and inventory movements.
- **Data Completeness**: Addresses challenges in data quality, especially regarding NULL values in `item_id` which indicate missing or untracked items.
- **Batch Data Processing**: Facilitates efficient bulk insert and update operations for large volumes of order data.

## Project Applications:
- Sales and order volume reporting by date, time, and item categories
- Operational insights for inventory restocking and order fulfillment
- Customer purchase pattern analysis through consolidated order summaries
- Time series analysis such as moving averages to smooth out fluctuations
- Data quality checks to identify and rectify missing or inconsistent data points

## Tools and Techniques:
- SQL for querying, aggregation, and data manipulation
- Bulk insert operations for efficient large data loads
- Window functions for trend and moving average calculations
- Data validation and cleaning strategies

This project provides a foundational dataset and analysis platform for businesses aiming to optimize order management and extract actionable insights into sales performance and customer demand.
