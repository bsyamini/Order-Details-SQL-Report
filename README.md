# Order-Details-SQL-Report
SQL-based report containing order details for analysis of sales, order trends, and customer behavior.

##Project Overview: Order Details Data Analysis
This project focuses on managing and analyzing detailed order transaction data typically found in e-commerce, retail, or inventory systems. The dataset contains order-level transaction details including unique order detail IDs, associated order IDs, order dates and times, and item identifiers.

##Core Components:
Order Details Table: Stores granulated information about each order line item with fields such as order_details_id (unique identifier), order_id (order grouping), order_date, order_time, and item_id.

- Time-based Analysis: Allows tracking of order trends and volumes by date and time to identify peak order times or seasonal patterns.

- Item-Level Insights: Enables product-level analysis from the item_id data to assess item popularity, sales quantity totals, and inventory movement.

- Data Completeness: Identifies challenges in data quality with NULL values in item_id which indicate missing or untracked items.

- Batch Data Processing: Supports bulk insert and update operations to efficiently manage large volumes of order data for reporting and decision-making.

##Project Applications:
- Sales and Order Volume Reporting by date, time, and item categories.
- Operational insights for inventory restocking and order fulfillment optimization.
- Customer purchase pattern analysis through consolidated order summaries.
- Time series analysis such as moving averages to smooth out daily order fluctuations.
- Data quality checks to address and rectify missing or inconsistent data points.

##Tools and Techniques:
- SQL for data querying, aggregation, and manipulation.
- Excel used to clean the dataset
- Bulk Insert operations for efficient large dataset loading.
- Use of window functions for trend and moving average calculations.
- Data validation and cleaning strategies to manage NULLs and anomalies.

This project serves as a foundational dataset and analysis platform for businesses looking to optimize order management and gain actionable insights into sales performance and customer demand
